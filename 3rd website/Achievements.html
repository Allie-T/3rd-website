		<p>Margaret Gee mentioned the racism she faced in her school, university, and in her work place. She noted that she had been fortunate for such incidents were relatively rare. Although, that wasn't the case for everyone, Anti-Chinese racism was a huge problem in the 1900s, espcially in BC. Even for educated Chinese-Canadians, succeeding in Canada was very difficult. Depsite all the obstacles, Margaret Gee still managed have many great acheivements.  </p>
