		<h2>Margaret Gee's work and learning environment</h2>
		
		<p>There was a lot of anti-Chinese racism in the 1900s, espcially in BC. Even for educated Chinese-Canadians, succeeding in Canada was difficult nonetheless.  </p>
		
		<p>Margaret Gee mentioned the racism she faced in her school, university, and in her work place. She noted that she had been fortunate for such incidents were relatively rare. In an interview with Vancouver Province, Margaret Gee showed gratitude for the kindness shown to her by older members of the legal profession.</p>

		<p>There were very few female lawyers in North America at the time. Being one of the very few female lawyers, Margaret Gee stated that she liked being called a "lady lawyer". On top of being one of the very few female lawyers, she was also first of many other things.</p>
